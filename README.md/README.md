## Description

Github repository :https://github.com/Cersion/triangle-tracker.git gh-page : https://cersion.github.io/triangle-tracker/ This webapp is designed to help a user check which type of triangle it is according to the dimensions he/she has input.Irrespective of how big the figures are,the program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.However, when the users values don't pass any of the checks,the program will inform you the dimensions used can't form a triangle.
